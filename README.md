Use data collected from a single accelerometer to record a hand movement sequence as a means to generally “unlock” our resource. This recorded sequence is saved on the microcontroller, using a “Record Key”
feature. A correct replication of the key sequence within sufficient tolerances will unlock the resource, indicated by the lighting up of green LEDs on our microprocessor.
